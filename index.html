      Tuning into Rider Voices: Community-Centered Solutions for an Equitable MBTA
    </h3>
    <p class="new-paragraph">BOSTON - The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), known locally as “the T”, is the public transit system serving the Greater Boston area. It operates various subway, bus, commuter rail and ferry routes across eastern Massachusetts. However, after decades of underinvestment and deferred maintenance, the T is now facing an infrastructure crisis.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">According to data from the MBTA and other sources, the T’s performance has been steadily declining across numerous metrics.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">A recent survey of Emerson College students, who rely heavily on the T to commute to campus, and internships, echoes these issues. With nearly 90% of respondents indicating dissatisfaction with their overall T experience, students criticized slow speeds, long wait times, shuttle buses during repairs, and a lack of communication around delays.</p>

        <div class="slide-text"> 46% said the T only meets their commuting needs sometimes or rarely, and over 75% identified frequent delays, long wait times, and slow service as top complaints. As senior Anansya Latka noted: “the T gets me where I need to go but there is a lot of delays which often end up making the trip as long as it would have been if I had walked."</div>

      The survey results highlight the urgent need to rebuild public trust and deliver more reliable service, goals MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng has vocalized. “Repairing our infrastructure is essential to providing a safe and more reliable trip for our riders,” Eng said in a recent statement about Green Line repair work.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">However, students like senior TJ Taylor don’t feel the current repair approach is sustainable: “the constant construction that results in shutdowns really makes things difficult.”</p>
    <h3>A History of Issues</h3>
    <p class="new-paragraph">Historically, the T does not serve every part of Boston equally. After a history of competing with the city of New York to become the first city in America with public transportation, followed by a recent history of malfunctions and shutdowns that led to insufficient commutes across the city, the 'T' undoubtedly has much room for improvement. </p>
    <div class="image-wrap">
      <img src="Assets/Images/Streetcar.jpeg" alt="OG Streetcar" style="width: 300px;"> </div>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The T’s first electric streetcar debuted on January 1st, 1889, replacing the former stagecoaches (horse-drawn carriages) that had predetermined stops. This streetcar would travel from Allston Railroad Depot to Coolidge Corner and Park Square. Today, the Green Line C Branch still travels this route. This greatly increased the popularity of public transportation. Transit historians say that in the late 19th century Tremont Street was so crowded that citizens often joked that it would be faster to get to their destinations by walking along the roofs of their stalled streetcars. As a response to this, the Governor of Massachusetts and the Mayor of Boston commissioned the Rapid Transit Commission to make improvements by July 1891. The commission recommended four elevated railway lines and a tunnel for streetcars under Tremont Street. It also authorized the creation of the Boston Elevated Railway Company (BERy), which would ultimately form other railway companies in 1897. </p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">BERy was then absorbed by the MTA, then the MBTA. Despite no longer existing as a company, BERy’s influence over Boston’s public infrastructure remains substantial in two major ways: to adapt to Boston’s narrow and twisting roads, the company combined two 20-feet cars that would twist and turn in the middle to accommodate the streets of Boston. Now commonly known as articulated cars, this style of car is still used in the Green and Silver lines. The second was the implementation of subway tunnels: Tremont Street subway opened in 1897 as North America’s first subway tunnel. It is still in use today when commuters take the Green Line connecting the Boylston, Park Street, and Government Center stations. </p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The majority of the T’s structural and financial problems arose simultaneously with the increased ridership and demand for the T. They began to realize the issues with having an elevated railway line, as the seasons would change the wiring would be exposed to harsh weather conditions </p>

          <img src="Assets/Images/after.jpeg" alt="After">
        </div>
    <p class="new-paragraph">Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T Project) also known as the ‘Big Dig’, in September 1999 the MBTA began to move the majority of the city’s public transport underground forcing the MBTA to foot the bill for billions of dollars of projects, the T cut down on maintenance to accommodate and make way for the Big Dig. The project was completed in December 2007; the Boston Globe estimated that the project cost $22 billion, including interest, and that it would not be paid off until 2038. This estimate does not include the costs related to the construction mishaps and failures. The Green Line’s Extension project was announced in 2022 to much fanfare, costing the city $2.8 billion and adding to the city’s growing MBTA debt.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">This has only covered the technical problems with the T, not the more nuanced problems with the T such as how it does not service members of lower-income neighborhoods. When the Silver Line was introduced, it promised to service members of low-income communities that it would be a new rapid transit that would create more opportunities for commuters to travel, reducing congestion on the existing lines. Instead, the line became a bus route. Though the line is an effective and affordable form of public transportation, it is still slower and less efficient than a rail line and fails to meet the promises made to these minority communities. Reminding riders of the much more pervasive history of Boston’s relationship with its minority communities. </p>
    <h3>ENVISIONING AN EQUITABLE T</h3>

    <p class="new-paragraph">Incorporating community voices is vital to centering infrastructure fixes on riders’ needs. Pete Wilson, senior policy adviser at Transportation for Massachusetts, advocates for an independent MBTA board to boost accountability and transparency.</p>
    <div class="image-wrap">
      <img src="Assets/Images/Map.jpeg" alt="T Map" style="width: 400px"> </div>
    <p class="new-paragraph">“An independent board, which is being considered by the legislature, could be set up to issue corrective actions and even have enforcement authority. People have a concern about political malfeasance or intrusion into certain things, and safety on the T should not be one of them. The T must look beyond tunnel repairs to address riders’ desires holistically.” He said. “ More dedicated bus lanes could provide cheaper, quicker service during station renovations. And replacing the Silver Line with light rail would better connect underserved areas.”</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The LivableStreets Alliance, a transportation equity non-profit, believes that the T must look beyond tunnel repairs to address riders’ desires holistically. More dedicated bus lanes could provide cheaper, quicker service during station renovations. And replacing the Silver Line with light rail would better connect underserved areas.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">“The T must prioritize projects that help move more people quickly through the entire region,” said Stacy Thompson, executive director of LivableStreets Alliance. “There are opportunities now with new federal funding to improve service, but they must follow though.”</p>
    <h3>SIGNALS OF PROGRESS</h3>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The T’s commitments to reliability and public trust are encouraging. “Repairing our infrastructure is essential to providing a safe and more reliable trip,” said General Manager Phillip Eng. He emphasized that doubling previous work to eliminate Green Line speed restrictions will enhance service.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The LivableStreets Alliance highlighted flexible overnight bus lanes and collaboration with municipalities as best practices during maintenance. And state Rep. Adrian Madaro is advancing legislation to create an MBTA Ridership Commission incorporating rider voices into decision-making. To quantify progress, T officials should track service changes by neighborhood demographics and solicit community input to guide spending. An equitable vision would pair accessibility upgrades, fare discounts for lower-income riders and free transfers between lines with infrastructure modernization focused on inclusive mobility.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">MBTA riders have power through engagement, as Emerson’s survey brought frustrations to light and campaigns like #FixTheT maintains public pressure. Concerted advocacy and responsible T leadership can spur overdue reforms benefiting all.</p>
    <h3>NEXT STOP: AN EQUITABLE, MODERN MBTA</h3>
    <div class="image-wrap-2">
      <img src="Assets/Images/Station.jpeg" alt="Station" style="width: 400px"> </div>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The path remains long, but transforming Greater Boston’s transportation backbone for inclusive access would better serve diverse needs now while sustaining ably accommodating future growth. The T requires large-scale upgrades not as a return to a “normal” plagued by inequities, but as an opportunity to collaboratively reshape regional mobility to empower marginalized communities. Progress relies on sustaining informed public participation paired with accountable MBTA stewardship focused on equitably meeting riders’ wants.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">With strategic investments and an unwavering commitment to equity, Boston’s public transit system can transform from a car-centric relic designed primarily for 9-5 commuters into an innovation leader expanding opportunities for all residents through reliable, convenient and dignified mobility.</p>
